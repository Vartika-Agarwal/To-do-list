<h1>To-Do List</h1>
A simple and interactive To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. It also stores tasks in the browser's local storage so that tasks persist even after the page is refreshed.
<h2>Features</h2>

- **Add Tasks:** Enter new tasks using an input field and submit via a button or by pressing the Enter key.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed:** Click on tasks to toggle between completed and incomplete states.
- **Delete Tasks:** Each task has a delete button (represented by an "X") to remove it from the list.
- **Persistent Data Storage:** Tasks are stored in the browserâ€™s local storage so they remain even after the page is reloaded or the browser is closed.


## Local Storage

The application stores tasks in the browser's local storage using the `localStorage` API. Tasks are saved automatically when added or deleted, and retrieved when the page loads.
